1. Problem Description
Given an integer, A. Find and Return first positive A integers in ascending order containing only digits 1, 2, and 3.

NOTE: All the A integers will fit in 32-bit integers.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 29500



Input Format
The only argument given is integer A.



Output Format
Return an integer array denoting the first positive A integers in ascending order containing only digits 1, 2 and 3.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 3
Input 2:

 A = 7


Example Output
Output 1:

 [1, 2, 3]
Output 2:

 [1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 21]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Output denotes the first 3 integers that contains only digits 1, 2 and 3.
Explanation 2:

 Output denotes the first 7 integers that contains only digits 1, 2 and 3.

2. TODO

Problem Description
You are given the head of a linked list A and an integer B. Delete the B-th node from the linked list.

Note : Follow 0-based indexing for the node numbering.



Problem Constraints
1 <= size of linked list <= 105
1 <= value of nodes <= 109
0 <= B < size of linked list



Input Format
The first argument A is the head of a linked list.

The second arguement B is an integer.



Output Format
Return the head of the linked list after deletion



Example Input
Input 1:
A = 1 -> 2 -> 3
B = 1
Input 2:
A = 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
B = 0


Example Output
Output 1:
1 -> 3
Output 2:
3 -> 2 -> 1


Example Explanation
For Input 1:
The linked list after deletion is 1 -> 3.
For Input 2:
The linked list after deletion is 3 -> 2 -> 1.
